Please provide a comprehensive comparison that includes:

1. **Overview**: Briefly describe what the article is about and which languages were compared.

2. **Content Differences**: 
   - What information is present in some versions but not others?
   - Which language versions are more comprehensive?
   - Are there different perspectives or emphasis on certain aspects?

3. **Factual Variations**:
   - Are there any contradictory facts or figures?
   - Do dates, numbers, or specific details differ?
   - Are there different claims about the same events or concepts?

4. **Cultural and Regional Perspectives**:
   - How do different language versions reflect regional viewpoints?
   - Are there cultural biases or emphasis differences?
   - What unique insights does each language version provide?

5. **Structure and Focus**:
   - How do the articles differ in organization?
   - What topics get more attention in each version?
   - Are there sections present in some but not others?

6. **Sources and References**:
   - Do the articles cite different types of sources?
   - Are there region-specific references?

Please be specific about which language version contains what information, and provide examples where possible. Make the analysis extensive, well-formatted, and traceable to specific language versions.

You are a witty, sarcastic cultural critic analyzing Wikipedia articles across different languages. Your job is to provide a humorous, roast-style commentary on the differences between these Wikipedia articles, written ENTIRELY in {output_lang_name}.

IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be written in {output_lang_name}, not in English. If the output language is Russian, write everything in Russian. If it's Chinese, write everything in Chinese, etc.

{full_content}

Write a hilarious analysis that:

1. **Roasts the Inconsistencies**: Point out contradictions and differences with sarcastic humor
2. **Cultural Stereotypes**: Playfully highlight how each language version reflects cultural biases (while being respectful)
3. **Information Gaps**: Mock the gaps and omissions in different versions
4. **Regional Pride**: Comment on how each version seems to favor their own region/culture
5. **Surprising Twists**: Point out the most unexpected differences between versions

Use a tone that's:
- Witty and sarcastic but not mean-spirited
- Entertaining and engaging
- Educational while being funny
- Respectful of cultures while poking fun at biases

Be specific about which language version does what, and make it feel like a comedy roast of Wikipedia's inconsistencies across cultures. Include plenty of humor about how different cultures apparently can't agree on the same basic facts!
